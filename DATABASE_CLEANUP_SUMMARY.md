   - Workouts (depends on TrainingPlan)
   - TrainingPlans (depends on Goal)
   - Goals (depends on User)
   - Users (base table)

2. **Verification**: Post-cleanup verification confirmed all tables are empty:
   - Users remaining: 0
   - Goals remaining: 0
   - Training plans remaining: 0
   - Workouts remaining: 0
   - Workout logs remaining: 0

### Database Status:

  - Safety confirmation (can be bypassed with `--force` flag)
  - Proper foreign key constraint handling
  - Verification of cleanup success
  - Error handling and rollback capability

### Note:
The database structure and tables remain intact - only the data has been removed. The application is ready to accept new user registrations and goal creation with the enhanced workout UI features.
